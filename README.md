# PyPeVoc

PyPeVoc is a simple Phase Vocoder library intendend mostly to analysis of sounds. It aims to be flexible and easy to adapt, and is thus entirely written in Python, rathe than using some components in C, which would make it faster but harder to maintain.

## Phase Vocoder

***Phase Vocoding*** is a technique of decomposing a periodic sound into its ***quasi-sinusoidal*** components. These are sinewaves that have slowly-varying frequency and amplitude. 

Sine-wave decomposition allows a wide-range of analysis and resynthesis techniques, exemplified in the Wiki (soon to come)
